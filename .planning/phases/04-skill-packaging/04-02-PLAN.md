<objective>
Create installation guide and add consistent cross-references to all module READMEs for selective loading.

Purpose: INSTALL.md enables other Claude users to install the skill. Cross-references ensure Claude finds related content when navigating between modules, supporting progressive disclosure.

Output: skills/polymarket/INSTALL.md plus updated navigation in 7 module READMEs

Create skills/polymarket/INSTALL.md (SKILL-03):

**Title:** "# Installing Polymarket Skills"

**For Personal Use Section:**
```markdown
## For Personal Use

Copy the polymarket folder to your Claude skills directory:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[repo-path]/polymarket-skills.git

# Copy to Claude skills
cp -r polymarket-skills/skills/polymarket ~/.claude/skills/
```

Skills in `~/.claude/skills/` are available across all projects.
```

Note: Use placeholder `[repo-path]` for repository since not yet published.

**For Project Use Section:**
```markdown
## For Project Use

Copy to your project's .claude directory:

```bash
# Copy skill to project
cp -r polymarket-skills/skills/polymarket ./.claude/skills/
```

Project-level skills are available when working in that project.
```

**Verification Section:**
```markdown
## Verification

After installation, verify the skill loads:

1. Start a new Claude Code session
2. Type `/polymarket` to invoke the skill directly
3. Or ask "How do I authenticate with Polymarket?" to test auto-triggering

Expected: Claude loads the skill and provides Polymarket-specific guidance.
```

**Updating Section:**
```markdown
## Updating

To update to the latest version:

```bash
cd polymarket-skills
git pull
cp -r skills/polymarket ~/.claude/skills/   # Personal
# OR
cp -r skills/polymarket ./.claude/skills/   # Project
```

Check VERSION.md for changelog after updates.
```

**Troubleshooting Section:**
- If skill doesn't load: check SKILL.md exists in skills/polymarket/
- If auto-trigger fails: verify description field in SKILL.md frontmatter
- For permissions: ensure ~/.claude/skills/ is readable

**Requirements:**
- Claude Code (claude-code CLI or VS Code extension)
- Git (for cloning updates)

Audit each module README and ensure consistent "Related Documentation" section with cross-module links.

**For each README, add or verify a "Related Documentation" section near the bottom (before "Last updated"):**

**auth/README.md** - related to:
- trading/ (uses authenticated client)
- edge-cases/ (auth troubleshooting)
- library/ (client patterns)

**trading/README.md** - related to:
- auth/ (client setup prerequisite)
- market-discovery/ (finding token IDs)
- real-time/ (price updates)
- data-analytics/ (position tracking)
- edge-cases/ (order constraints)

**market-discovery/README.md** - related to:
- trading/ (uses discovered markets)
- real-time/ (subscribe to discovered markets)
- edge-cases/ (negRisk patterns)

**data-analytics/README.md** - related to:
- trading/ (position source)
- market-discovery/ (market context)
- library/ (production patterns)

**real-time/README.md** - related to:
- trading/ (live order tracking)
- market-discovery/ (market subscriptions)
- library/ (connection patterns)

**edge-cases/README.md** - related to:
- All modules as troubleshooting reference
- library/ (error handling)

**library/README.md** - related to:
- auth/ (initialization patterns)
- trading/ (order patterns)
- real-time/ (WebSocket patterns)
- edge-cases/ (error recovery)

**Format for Related Documentation section:**
```markdown
## Related Documentation

- **[Authentication](../auth/README.md)** - Client setup prerequisite
- **[Trading](../trading/README.md)** - Order placement and management
- [etc.]

[Back to Polymarket Skills](../SKILL.md)
```

**Rules:**
- Use relative paths (../module/)
- Add brief description of why related
- Include "Back to Polymarket Skills" link to ../SKILL.md
- Don't duplicate existing Related Skills sections - merge or replace as needed
- Preserve all existing content except updating Related sections
  </action>
  <verify>
Each of the 7 module READMEs has a "Related Documentation" section.
All links use relative paths (../module/).
Each README links back to ../SKILL.md.
Cross-references are bidirectional where logical.
  </verify>
  <done>
All module READMEs have consistent cross-references enabling Claude to discover related content for selective loading.
  </done>
</task>

<objective>
Create the main SKILL.md entry point and VERSION.md tracking file for the Polymarket skill.

Purpose: SKILL.md is the required entry point that triggers skill loading when users work with Polymarket. The description field enables auto-triggering. VERSION.md provides version tracking for API changes.

Output: skills/polymarket/SKILL.md, skills/polymarket/VERSION.md

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create main SKILL.md entry point</name>
  <files>skills/polymarket/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Create skills/polymarket/SKILL.md following Claude Code skill format:

**Frontmatter (YAML):**
```yaml
---
name: polymarket
description: Polymarket prediction market API expertise. Use when implementing Polymarket trading bots, authentication flows, market discovery, WebSocket connections, or debugging py-clob-client issues. Covers CLOB API, Gamma API, Data API, edge cases like USDC.e vs native USDC, order constraints, and production patterns.
---
```

**Body Content (keep under 200 lines):**

1. **Title:** "# Polymarket API Skills"

2. **One-sentence intro:** What this skill provides (complete knowledge base)

3. **Quick Navigation Section:**
   - First time setup? -> auth/README.md
   - Finding markets? -> market-discovery/README.md
   - Placing orders? -> trading/README.md
   - Real-time data? -> real-time/README.md
   - Analytics/positions? -> data-analytics/README.md
   - Something not working? -> edge-cases/README.md
   - Library patterns? -> library/README.md

4. **Essential Context Section (always in context):**
   - API Base URLs (CLOB, Gamma, Data)
   - Key contract addresses (USDC.e, CTF Exchange, etc.)
   - Network: Polygon (chain_id=137)

5. **Critical Warnings (top 3 pitfalls):**
   - USDC.e not Native USDC
   - FOK orders: 2 decimal precision required
   - Proxy wallets: use proxy address as funder, not EOA

6. **Version Reference:** Link to VERSION.md

Use relative paths for all links (./auth/README.md not absolute paths).
Target: 100-150 lines (concise but complete).

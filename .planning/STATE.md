## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Skills-based approach: Allows selective loading of Polymarket knowledge when needed, shareable format
- Deep research before documenting: Official docs may be incomplete or ambiguous; need to understand actual behavior
- Use create_or_derive_api_creds() as recommended method: Safer for initial setup, retrieves existing rather than invalidating (01-01)
- Document nonce tracking as critical: Without nonce, credential recovery impossible (01-01)
- Separate L1/L2 authentication documentation: Clarifies different purposes and when each is used (01-01)

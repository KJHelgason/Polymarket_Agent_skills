# Polymarket Skills for Claude Code

A knowledge package that gives Claude deep expertise in Polymarket integration — API patterns, WebSocket handling, edge cases, and troubleshooting.

## What This Does

When loaded, Claude knows Polymarket as well as someone who's built with it extensively:

- Correct authentication flows (L1/L2, API credentials, token approvals)
- All REST API endpoints with request/response schemas
- WebSocket subscription patterns for real-time data
- Edge cases that cause silent failures (tick sizes, minimum orders, precision limits)
- py-clob-client library patterns and gotchas

No more guessing at endpoints or making common mistakes.

## Installation

### Personal Use (all projects)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KJHelgason/Polymarket_Agent_skills.git
cp -r Polymarket_Agent_skills/skills/polymarket ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Project Use (single project)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KJHelgason/Polymarket_Agent_skills.git
cp -r Polymarket_Agent_skills/skills/polymarket ./.claude/skills/
```

## Usage

**Explicit invocation:**
```
/polymarket
```

**Auto-triggers on questions like:**
- "How do I authenticate with Polymarket?"
- "What's the endpoint for placing orders?"
- "Why is my order getting rejected?"
